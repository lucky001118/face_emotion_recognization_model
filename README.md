# Face Emotion Recognition

This project is a **Face Emotion Recognition System** built using Machine Learning. It detects human emotions by analyzing facial expressions in real-time or from images. The core of this project is a trained deep learning model that can classify facial emotions such as *Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral,* and more.

## 📌 Features

- Detects faces in images or video streams.
- Classifies emotions with high accuracy.
- Pre-trained deep learning model.
- Easy to integrate into applications.
- Real-time emotion prediction using webcam.
- Clean, modular, and well-documented code.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV** for face detection.
- **NumPy, Pandas** for data handling.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face_emotion_recognition.git
   cd face_emotion_recognition

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
**1. Train the model:**

``bash
python src/train.py
``
(Skip if using the pre-trained model provided.)

**2 Predict emotion for an image:**

``bash
python src/predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
``
**3. Run real-time emotion detection with webcam:**

``bash
python src/webcam.py
``

## 🗂️ Dataset
The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which includes labeled images of human faces expressing different emotions.

## 📊 Results
The trained model achieves good accuracy on the test set. Example predictions:

Emotion	Accuracy
Happy	93%
Sad	90%
Angry	88%
Neutral	92%

## ✏️ Future Improvements
Improve model accuracy with larger datasets.

Add support for video emotion analytics.

Deploy as a web or mobile application.

Integrate with chatbots or virtual assistants.
